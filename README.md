# GNN for Multi-task Learning in PyTorch
## 1. Overview

This repository contains most common Graph Neural Networks based graph embedding models for multi-task learning, implemented in PyTorch.

Neural network methods:
- Logisitic Regression (LR)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU)
- Text Convolutional Neural Newtork (TextCNN)
- Hieriarchical Attention Network (HAN)

Embedding models:
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Graph Convolution Networks (GCN)
- Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
- HighWay Graph Convolution Networks (H-GCN)

All models can be trained for:
- Node classification (NC)
- Link Prediction (LP)
- Entity Alignment (EA)
